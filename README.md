# A VueJS app configured to be embedded to Wordpress site

When embedding a VueJS application into a WordPress site, it is important to make sure that the app is properly configured to work within the WordPress ecosystem. This often involves creating a separate page template in WordPress for the Vue app, setting up the app to attach to a specific DOM element on the page, and making sure that any necessary dependencies and plugins are properly incorporated into the project. Additionally, it is a good idea to ensure that the Vue app is optimized for performance and security, and that it is compatible with any other plugins or themes that are being used on the WordPress site. With the proper setup and configuration, a VueJS application can be seamlessly integrated into a WordPress site, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive user experience.
